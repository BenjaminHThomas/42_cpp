BANE: Ahhh you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!

*Bane grabs Batman out of the shadows*

BANE: The shadows betray you because they belong to me!

*Bane punches a defeated Batman on his mask repeatedly*

BANE: I will show where I've made my home whilst preparing to bring justice. Then I'll break you.

*Bane blows a hole in the ceiling revealing Batmans armory*

BANE: Your precious armory! Gratefully accepted! We will need it.

*Batman gets up, obviously weakened*

BANE: Ah yes I was wondering which would break first...

*Batman charges at Bane but is knocked to the ground*

BANE: Your spirit...

*Bane lifts Batman over his head*
BANE: Or your body!

*Bane drops Batman on his knee breaking Batman's back*
